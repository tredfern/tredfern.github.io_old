I am developing a sequence of tutorials dealing with programming in games.
Currently, I'm planning on three different series with increasing 
complexity:

1. A basic Asteroids like clone
1. A turn-based strategy game similar to the old Empire series
1. A roguelike RPG

My current plan is that these will be created using the [Love2d](https://love2d.org/) engine
in Lua. We will be building the applications with a focus on construction principles
like working with Git, TDD, and integrating Travis-CI. We will also hand roll the majority
of the code in order to take time to build out underlying concepts and explore
a variety of problems.

These tutorials will be posted on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh8slcmx8aXUYhKGOYkduOQ).
The code will be located on my [Github](https://github.com/tredfern) account and
available to all. I will also provide some refinements, details, and more specific
instructions on this blog as necessary.

I am looking forward to putting these together and I hope that you find them useful.
