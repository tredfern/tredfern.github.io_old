It's 2021 and we all have survived a long year. To kick off this year right for myself, I've decided to develop a game online while streaming to twitch. [WhereTheRedfernCodes](https://twitch.tv/wheretheredferncodes)

## About the Project

* [Open-Source](https://github.com/tredfern/terminus)
* A classic Rogue style project
* Using Test-Driven Development to achieve as close to 100% test coverage as possible
  * (BTW - It's not so much that test coverage that high is that valuable, as much as a challenge)
* Title might change, it's just a working title
