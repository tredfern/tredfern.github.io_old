In an Agile adjustment of plans, my first tutorial series is going to be building [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
I have built versions of this in C++, Python, .NET, and now Lua. I always learn
something from working on it and I believe it helps me understand a new programming
language.

## Tutorial Overview
The tutorials will be posted to 
[YouTube](https:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dC6L9SeDvP64q-zyZg0zFvscFj7n3Xr).

The outline of the tutorials will be:
1. Setting up the development environment
1. Basic implementation of the game
1. Profiling and Optimizing
1. Finishing touches and flare

## Why?
Conway's Game of Life is an effective teaching tool of programming concepts and always an opportunity for engineers of any level to learn something new. 
The rules are simple enough to not require much challenge in implementing but optimization performance and code organization allow for experimentation.

For game development, we remove the constraints of art and user input and allow us as engineers to focus on the inner workings of the engine. 

## What I Learned
I came to better appreciate the Lua language and how to structure the code. Tables are a great design and there are more opportunities to utilize them then I took advantage of in this project. I'm excited to explore the possibilities in future projects. 
I caused a mysterious fatal crashing bug that was resolved by organization of code. More advice on that later. I also renewed my appreciation for this simple simulation. I hope that you enjoy working through the series as much as I have had in putting it together.
