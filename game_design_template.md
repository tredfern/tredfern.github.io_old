# --TITLE-- Game Design

## Concept

_In a few sentences, describe the idea. This should not describe all the mechanics but should give an idea of your current direction_

## Inspiration

_Inspiration should feel open, and it should be a source you can return to when you need energy to move forward on the project._

**Money is not always a goal for projects, but it is worth considering if you are going to make income from this, how might you go about that? Continuous support from loyal fans, sales on a platform, advertisements?**

## Risks

_It is always worthwhile to look out for pitfalls. Explore the feelings about why you would not succeed. Learning to tackle or having a plan to deal with those challenges can be the difference between succeeding and another incomplete idea._

**What are some unanswered questions for you right now?**

**What skills do you need to complete this project successfully?**

**What is the hardest part about this project?**

**How committed are you to the project? What can you do to help stay focused on the project?**

**What additional/outside help do you need to complete the project?**

**What are the ways that the project fails?**

**How big does the project feel?**

**What is SCARY about this project?**

**What dependencies exist for this project? Are you working on this with multiple people? Do you need a specific library or technology to be released?**

## Breaking it Down

_Time to start breaking down your idea to get some milestones and steps together. This is where your thinking needs to turn to action._

### Scoping
_Describe the elements of the game/project that are in/out of scope. Use your thoughts from risk combined with creativity to identify the things you really need, and those things that will make the project less likely to succeed._

### Milestones
_Articulate a series of milestones to measure your progress. Milestones don't need to be major releases. Getting a compiled version of a game with a title screen might be a milestone if that is a worthwhile amount of work for you. You can always add more milestones as you learn more about the project_
