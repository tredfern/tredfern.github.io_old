### Terminus Development Log
Welcome! After a tiring 2020, I decided to do something different for myself in 2021. 
Each weekend, I will be streaming live development for 3-4 hours on this project and talking about what steps I'm taking. I will be try and provide insights into how to write clean tests, different ways to solve programming challenges, and at some point, maybe even have an interesting product.

This is a summary of development for the project [Terminus](https://github.com/tredfern/terminus). I will discuss some of the commits made with links to the source code. Depending on complexity, I'll describe why I made the decisions I did or what tradeoffs to consider. 

Feel free to reach out with questions and suggestions.
-Trevor
