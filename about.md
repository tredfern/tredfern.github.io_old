I learned to program on a Commodore 64. 
When I wasn't playing games I was I typing in games out the back of [Compute's Gazette]( https://archive.org/details/compute-gazette). 
You didn't think in terms of functions, you crammed the code where
it fit in the line number sequence *(Remember, always count by 10 so you could go back and insert
more instructions later!)*  
But the concepts of memory, variables, arrays, programming structure and problem solving 
informs my understanding of development to this day.

I moved on through the era of GWBasic and QBasic in MS-DOS, Visual Basic 3-6 on Windows,
C++ with that amazing DirectX library. QueryInterface much? 
Programming was something I did professionally. Then I would go home, play music, and 
code into the late night.

As my career progressed I learned about the architecture principles
of SOLID, TDD, and Agile processes. I developed in more languages like NodeJS, Ruby, C# and Lua. 
I have worked in nearly a dozen different industries and I find the problems that each industry presents as a challenge and fascinating to learn about. I learned to use [VIM](https://github.com/vim/vim).

These days, my professional career has moved on from programming. I build teams
of programmers and work to help them succeed. I love that work. 

But my passion will always be in the code.
It's my belief that a misunderstanding about coding is that it's something strange
and foreign. That somehow, something has to be a little off for someone to enjoy it.
I feel that coding is as human an expression as arts, music and writing. It's 
a way of communicating complex ideas in our heads. How cool is that? 

I want to give back for all the people that have taught me, for all the mistakes 
I've made, and for all the joy I've experienced. I want to share the way I think
about coding so that maybe it will help someone else find more enjoyment.
