  <h3>Welcome to the Terminus Devlog</h3>
  <p>Terminus is a sci-fi roguelike that has been underdevelopment since January 2021. 
    It is going to be awesome because it will feature some ideas I have to improve the
    generally dreadful experience with <em>crafting</em> in every game. Also, I have plans for
    making the <em>NPCs</em> the key roguelike characters as opposed to the hero. Meaning, saving and
    preserving NPCs isn't just good experience points, it's critical to leveling up to succeed at the game.
  </p>
  
  <p>This blog covers roughly weekly updates on the progress for the project.</p>
